					<h1>WHY I LOVE RADIOHEAD?</h1>
					<p> My fondness of the band goes beyond liking on of their earliest known song entitled Creep. Their music carry messages succinctly and embodies deep emotions that most harbour and are afraid to tap into. Some songs I like include: </p><ul>
						<li class="item1">True Love Waits</li>
						<li class="item2">Karma Police</li>
						<li class="item3">Talkshow Host</li>
						<li class="item4">I Might Be Wrong</li>
						<li class="item5">Fake Plastic Trees</li>
					</ul>More info about the band: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Radiohead&oldid=1032236447" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Wikipedia about Radiohead</a>

				<p>Thomas Edward Yorke, or Thom Yorke is not just a singer that I admire, but a citizen of this planet that I want to emulate. He may come off as weird to many, but his akwardness is almost the same trait that I admire in the likes of the U.S. comedian Conan O' Brien.Both are smart, educated from well known universities and both can be considered relevant in their chosen careers.<br><br> Thom Yorke's Wikipedia Entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thom_Yorke&oldid=1029924111" target="_blank">here</a></p>

					<figcaption class="memberpic-caption">Jonny Greenwood</figcaption> 
				</figure>	
				<p>Jonny uses music to open portals that listeners can use to visit other realms. Aside from having a distinct and unique of playing the guitar, synth and piano, he can be regarded one of the great classical musicians. His music stretches from the conventional to the unconventional. Just like Thom, Jonny has successfuly created music as a solo artist and collaborated with various artists in the music industry world-wide.<br><br> Jonny Greenwood's Wikipedia Entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jonny_Greenwood&oldid=1031520034" target="_blank">here</a></p>

					<figcaption class="memberpic-caption">Ed O'Brien</figcaption> 
				</figure>	
				<p>Ed's voice is a great complement to Thom's, but as a guitarist myself, I admire how he adds another dimension to the guitar works of his bandmates Jonny and Thom. Just like Jonny, Ed incorporates other genres of music and elevates the sound of Radiohead. Ed adds a flavor of electronic, jazz, punk and others to Radiohead's rock sound.<br><br> Ed O'Brien's Wikipedia Entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ed_O%27Brien&oldid=1031978563" target="_blank">here</a></p>

					<figcaption class="memberpic-caption">Colin Greenwood</figcaption> 
				</figure>	
				<p>Colin plays the bass unlike other bass players. Along with the band, he does not only establish a great tempo and melodic lines that characterizes Radiohead's unique musical style, but he skews the listeners heart beats' syncopation. Just like his brother, he is a great musician. When you watch some reaction Youtube videos of their music, many mention his melodic bass lines as underrated.<br><br> Colin Greenwood's Wikipedia Entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colin_Greenwood&oldid=1026085785" target="_blank">here</a></p>

					<figcaption class="memberpic-caption">Phil Selway</figcaption> 
				</figure>	
				<p>Phil is not a flambouyant drummer like John Bonham, Neil Peart, or Dave Grohl. He is more like Ringo of the Beatles that keeps the listeners grounded in his steady time signature, while his band mates explore another time signature. He offers the steadiness of a drum machine and the randomness necessary to glue together Radiohead's often off-beat, syncopated music. <br><br> Philip Selway's Wikipedia Entry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Philip_Selway&oldid=1026099723" target="_blank">here</a></p>
